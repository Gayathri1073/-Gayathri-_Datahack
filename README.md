Based on the **problem description**, I tackled the task using Python and several steps to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving their** xyz and seasonal flu vaccines**. Hereâ€™s a detailed outline of my approach:

1. **Data Loading**: Initially, I utilized the pandas library to load the dataset using  CSV command, ensuring all relevant data was imported for analysis.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: I carefully inspected the dataset to identify any missing values.** For numerical columns, I imputed missing values using the median**, which is robust against outliers. **For categorical columns (object type), I filled missing values with the mod**e of each respective column to preserve data integrity.

3. **Categorical Encoding**: To prepare categorical data for modeling, I employed two distinct encoding strategies based on the nature of the variables:
   - **Ordinal Encoder**: Applied to ordinal variables where the order matters (e.g., education level).
   - **One-Hot Encoder**: Used for nominal variables without inherent order (e.g., region).

4. **Splitting the Data**: I partitioned the dataset into training and validation sets. This segregation allows for training the model on one portion of the data and validating its performance on another, enhancing reliability.

5. **Model Selection**: For the predictive task, I opted to use the** RandomForestClassifier** from scikit-learn. This ensemble method is robust and effective for classification tasks, particularly suitable given the dataset characteristics. RandomForest Classifier is giving good results than Logistic Regression and some other models.

6. **Model Training and Validation**: Using the validation set, I trained the RandomForestClassifier model to predict the probabilities of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. Subsequently, I evaluated the model's performance on the validation set using ROC AUC scores:
   - ROC AUC for xyz_vaccine: 0.8315
   - ROC AUC for seasonal_vaccine: 0.8540

7. **Generating Submission File**: After validating the model, I created a **submission file** containing predictions for the testing dataset. This file includes the probabilities estimated by the trained model for both xyz and seasonal vaccines, ensuring it adheres to the submission format requirements.

By following this structured approach, I aimed to maximize the predictive accuracy of the model while ensuring robustness and adherence to best practices in data preprocessing and machine learning modeling.
